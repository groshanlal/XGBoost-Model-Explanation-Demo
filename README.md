# XGBoost-Model-Explanation-Demo

This demo shows how to explain a XGBoost model trained on numerical and categorical feratures. The explanation includes human understandable rules to explain the positive class prediction by the XGBoost Model. For negative class predictions, the rules can give a counterfactual explanation regarding what needs to be changed in the input to get a positive prediction by the model. The explanations are generated by using TE2Rules algorithm. More details on TE2Rules can be found [here](https://github.com/linkedin/TE2Rules/). 

The demo is available in the form of a Jupyter Notebook: [Model Explanation Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/groshanlal/XGBoost-Model-Explanation-Demo/blob/main/Model%20Explanation%20Demo.ipynb). 

The demo is also available as a python code. To run the demo code from terminal, run:
```bash
python3 run.py
```
